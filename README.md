Using the IDE IntelliJ, make sure that the latest version of Junit Library has been installed. (This project uses JUnit 5.7.0 version)
To test all methods at once go to the JunitTestingTest.java file and run the program to see if all test pass.
To test each method, go to one of the following classes to test the method that you desire to test:
  1. CountTest.java will count how many times the letter 'A' will appear in a word (either capitialized or not) You can change the word inside of the test.count method and see if works with other words. 
  2. DivideTest.java will test if the quotient of the division problem is correct. You can use both negative and positive numbers in this test. To test out more numbers, change the two numbers inside of test.divide() 
  3. SquareTest.java will test if the output of the number being squared is correct. Only one positive number can be tested at a time.
